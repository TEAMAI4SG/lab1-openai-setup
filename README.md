## ❓ What is an API? And why do we need a key to use it?

Think of an API (Application Programming Interface) as a middleman that lets different software programs talk to each other — like a waiter in a restaurant who takes your order and communicates it to the kitchen.

An API key is like a special passcode. Just like you need a key card to enter certain doors in an office building, software needs this API key to access services provided by another software. This key is **unique**, meaning it's specifically assigned to you. It ensures interactions are safe and authenticated.

In our case, the **OpenAI API connects OpenAI’s models with the code we run in our labs.** And our OpenAI API key will act as our personalized access code.

## 🔑 Creating an OpenAI API Key

1. Sign up for an OpenAI account, or log in if you have one already.  
   👉 https://platform.openai.com/signup  
   👉 https://platform.openai.com/login?launch

5. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**: COPY AND SAVE YOUR API KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.  
   ⚠️ You will not be able to view it again!

6. Navigate to the **Usage** page via the left sidebar and check your usage.

   - The Usage page helps you visually track API calls and manage costs.
   - New accounts will have **$5 in free credits**, which expire after 3 months.
   - If using an older account, load $5 in credits manually.
